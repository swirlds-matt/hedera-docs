Hedera ETL populates BigQuery dataset with transactions and records generated by the Hedera Mainnet (or Testnet, if so configured).

* Extract: Stream of transactions (and records) are ingested from a GCP PubSub topic
* Transform: Filters for important fields, formats data types, etc
* Load: Streaming insert into BigQuery dataset
