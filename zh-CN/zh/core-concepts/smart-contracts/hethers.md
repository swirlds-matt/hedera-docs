**Deprecation of Hethers.js by October 20, 2023**

\
As we continue to evolve and improve the Hedera ecosystem, we are committed to ensuring that our developer tools and resources remain easy to use and up-to-date. With this goal in mind, the **Hethers.js library will be deprecated by October 20, 2023**.
{% endhint %}

[Hethers](https://github.com/hashgraph/hethers.js/) is a complete and compact library for interacting with the _Hedera Hashgraph_ and more specifically, the Smart Contract Service. It is a fork of [The Ethers Project](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/) and implements the same program interface as _ethers.js_ with minor changes.

Please check out Hethers library documentation [here](https://docs.hedera.com/hethers/).
